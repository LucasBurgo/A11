  <h3>February<br><strong>Scott Sampson</strong></h3>
  <p>
    What’s 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage Utahceratops! 
    Come to the Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur roar, when Scott Sampson, 
    Research Curator at the Utah Museum of Natural History, steps to the podium. 
    Sampson’s research has focused on the ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous 
    dinosaurs and he has conducted fieldwork in a number of countries in Africa.
  </p>
    <p>
      Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Toronto. 
      His doctoral work focused on two new species of ceratopsids (horned dinosaurs) from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, 
      as well as the growth and function of ceratopsid horns and frills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year at the American Museum of Natural History in NYC, then five years 
      as assistant professor of anatomy at New York College of Osteopathic Medicine. He later arrived at the University of Utah 
      as assistant professor in Geology and Geophysics and curator at the Utah Museum of Natural History. His interests include 
      phylogenetics, morphology, and dinosaur evolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sampson has led digs in Zimbabwe, South Africa, Madagascar, the US, and Canada. He hosted the Discovery Channel’s 
      *Dinosaur Planet* and published *Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life*, one of the most comprehensive 
      dinosaur surveys to date.
